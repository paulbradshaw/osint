# Tracking people through Instagram and advanced search techniques

At the 2019 CIJ Summer School Henk Van Ess talked about an investigation tracking a wanted criminal through Instagram. The techniques included:

* Prioritising material when faced with hundreds of videos/images (focusing on person-with-object)
* The use of reverse image search and Yandex
* The use of text recognition in Google Image Search to look for licence plates, signs etc.
* The use of colour specification in Google Image Search to narrow those searches
* Using advanced search operators to look for Instagram activity *outside* of the person's account page
* Converting video into panoramic images
* Exporting media from Telegram channels
