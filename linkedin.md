# LinkedIn for journalists - notes from a training session

You see updates about 2nd and 3rd tier connections, so it's worth building a large network to be able to see as many as possible.

See your connections at [https://www.linkedin.com/mynetwork/](https://www.linkedin.com/mynetwork/)

Uses of LinkedIn for journalists:

* Ask for introductions
* Ask questions of your network

**[Profile viewing options](https://www.linkedin.com/me/profile-views/urn:li:wvmp:summary/)** allow you to switch to a **Private mode** when looking at other profiles so others don't know you looked: find this on the homepage, upper right after clicking *[Who's viewed my profile](https://www.linkedin.com/me/profile-views/urn:li:wvmp:summary/)*

You can find these by clicking on 'Me' in the upper menu, selecting *Settings and privacy*, then [switching to the *Privacy* tab](https://www.linkedin.com/psettings/privacy). Scroll down to *How others see your LinkedIn activity* and change the settings there.

## Advanced search

*Clear any filters across the top first*

Search for name then open advanced filters, specify company, language, connection level, etc.

Search for company first, then use advanced search to find people in sections.

**People who did work in a company**: again under advanced search - **Past companies** but *also* set **Current companies** to a different company to exclude those still at the company in a new role. Example: [Commons Speaker John Bercow accused of bullying private secretary](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-43963788)

**Alerts**: after doing a search on the right there is a *Create alert* option to be notified when someone matches your search.

**InMail** gives you 15 credits but these are refunded whenever someone replies, so can keep being used as long as you're not spamming.

**Areas of industry expansion or reduction**: Search for a keyword (e.g. blockchain) then switch search from *People* to *Jobs*. Create job alert to continue being notified. (Could have been used for Jane Haynes's internships story). Examples: [Apple Is On The Hunt For Medical Tech Talent](https://www.buzzfeed.com/stephaniemlee/apple-is-ramping-up-its-medical-tech-workforce?utm_term=.ooj8Neg8m#.cqP5ZKk5R) by BuzzFeed, or [iPhone supplier Dialog is losing staff to Apple](http://uk.businessinsider.com/iphone-supplier-dialog-is-losing-staff-to-apple-2017-12)

**Company pages** include extra insights on Pro account, such as staff numbers ([try Bell Pottinger](https://www.linkedin.com/company/bell-pottinger-group/)) and new hires (try Carillion - note they stopped hiring from October, months before they went bust) - perhaps [Oxfam](https://www.linkedin.com/company/oxfam/) would be another one.

**Boolean search**

You can use these operators to limit your searches:

* firstname:
* lastname:
* title:
* company:
* school:
* NOT, AND, OR

**Groups**: find experts, e.g. 'Tall buildings fire safety' (select *Groups*). You can see who has created the group even if it's private, and approach them.

Make sure your profile has examples of your work to make sources more likely to contact you. The profile of Wall Street Journal reporter John Carreyrou, for example, made it possible for him to [expose the Theranos scam](https://www.theringer.com/2018/5/22/17378494/bad-blood-theranos-john-carreyrou-interview)
